## TODO ##


# ideas from katie #
 - files can be shared, have multiple owners/users
    - would need file -> user table
    - OPTION 2: 
        - files have one owner. Each user has a list of files shared with them.
 - download files in filetype


# ideas from aj #

# actual TODO #
 - Set up postgres
    - remove lobby.ex, and modify database file directly
